		// The FlxG.bitmap cache contains the following:
		// - Graphics loaded using FlxSprite.loadGraphic
		//     We need to clear these, and Flixel will safely reload them when needed, appropriately loading modded content.
		// - Graphics created wholesale using FlxSprite.makeGraphic or FlxText
		//     We can't clear these, though mods don't override them so we're fine here.
		// - Graphics created from calling FlxGraphic.fromFrame on another graphic
		//     We can't clear these, but the graphic they come from may be modded.
		//     If you happen to be using this and you load or unload mods, it might leave old content behind.

		// Try the following if you're having problems with this:
		// - Set the `Cache` argument to false on any calls to `loadGraphic` and manage/clear the cache yourself.
		// - Avoid use of functions that might create a new graphic based on one loaded from an asset.
		//     TODO: Does FlxAtlasFrames do this?
		// - Require the user to restart the application after modding.
		//     You can invoke a system process to launch the game's own executable, then exit.

		// The workaround used here is to fetch the list of all bitmaps, and attempt to clear each.
